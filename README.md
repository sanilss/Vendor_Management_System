# Vending Machine Program

## Overview

This project implements a simple vending machine system in Java. It consists of several classes:

- **VendingMachine:** Manages the vending machine operations such as updating inventory, handling transactions, and managing the coin float.
- **Product:** Represents a product available in the vending machine.
- **Coin:** Represents a coin denomination in the vending machine.
- **VendingMachineException:** Custom exception class for handling vending machine-related exceptions.
- **Main:** Main class containing the entry point for the program and user interface.

## Design

The program follows a modular design with separate classes for different components of the vending machine. Here's an overview of the design:

- **VendingMachine:** Handles core functionalities such as updating inventory, handling transactions, and managing the coin float.
- **Product and Coin:** Represent the products and coin denominations available in the vending machine, respectively.
- **VendingMachineException:** Provides a mechanism for handling exceptions specific to vending machine operations.
- **Main:** Contains the main method and user interface for interacting with the vending machine.

## Reasoning

The design aims to provide a simple and modular solution for managing a vending machine. Each class encapsulates specific functionalities, promoting code reusability and maintainability. Custom exception handling ensures robust error handling, enhancing the reliability of the program.

## Instructions

### Running the Program in Eclipse IDE

#### Import Project:

1. Open Eclipse IDE.
2. Go to File > Import.
3. Choose General > Existing Projects into Workspace.
4. Browse to the directory containing your project and select it.
5. Click Finish to import the project into Eclipse.

#### Run Main Class:

1. In the Project Explorer, navigate to the Main.java file within your project.
2. Right-click on Main.java.
3. Select Run As > Java Application.

This will execute the Main class, which serves as the entry point for the program.

### Interacting with the Program:

Once the program is running, follow the on-screen instructions in the Eclipse Console to interact with the vending machine.
Enter the corresponding option number and follow the prompts to perform actions such as buying a product, updating inventory, etc.

### Running Tests in Eclipse IDE

#### Set Up JUnit:

Ensure that JUnit is configured in your Eclipse IDE. You can verify this by checking if the JUnit library is included in your project's build path.

#### Run Tests:

1. In the Project Explorer, navigate to the VendingMachineTest.java file within the test package.
2. Right-click on VendingMachineTest.java.
3. Select Run As > JUnit Test.

This will execute the unit tests defined in the VendingMachineTest class and show the results in the JUnit view.

## Exercising the Program

Once the program is running, follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the vending machine. You can perform the following actions:

- Buy a product
- Check inventory
- Update inventory
- Update coin float
- Display coin float
- Exit the program

Simply enter the corresponding option number and follow the prompts.
